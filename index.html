										<h2>KERALA -</h2> <h3>Thrissur, Fort Kochi, Munnar and Kozhikode </h3>

<p>For many travellers, Kerala is South India's most serenely beautiful state. A slender coastal strip is shaped by its layered landscape: almost 600km of glorious Arabian Sea coast and beaches; a languid network of glistening backwaters; and the spice and tea-covered hills of the Western Ghats. Just setting foot on this swath of soul-quenching, palm-shaded green will slow your subcontinental stride to a blissed-out amble. Kerala is a world away from the frenzy of elsewhere, as if India had passed through the Looking Glass and become an altogether more laid-back place.</p>

<h3>THRISSUR</h3>
<p>Located 300 kilometers towards north-west of the state capital of Kerala, it is known as the Cultural Capital because of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings. Historically being the centre of Hindu scholarship, it has one of the most famous temple of Hindu Shaivism, that is the Vadakunnathan Temple. Home to a number of temples, it is also famous for its churches, being masterpieces of architecture.</p>
 
<h3>FORT KOCHI</h3>
<p>Located in the port city of Kerala, Fort Kochi is a part of a handful of water bound regions. The European inspired architectural style of the buildings and the town layout easily make Fort Kochi distinct from the other cities of Kerala. Fort Emmanuel, (after which Fort Kochi is named) built by Portuguese, is believed to be one of the first church built in India.</p> 

<h3>MUNNAR</h3>
<p>Set at an altitude of 1600 meters above sea level, Munnar is a town and a hill station in the Western Ghats range of mountains, towards south-west Kerala. It is known for its unending expanse of tea plantations, pristine valleys and mountains, exotic flora and fauna in its wild sanctuaries and forests, aroma of spice scented cool air.</p>
 
<h3>KOZHIKODE</h3>
<p>Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, is a coastal city in the state of Kerala in southern India. Basking in the idyllic setting of the serene Arabian Sea on the West and the proud peaks of the Wayanad hills on the east, this district with its beautiful beaches, lush green countryside, historic sites, all combine to make Kozhikode a popular tourist destination with a warm ambience to fascinate a visitor.</p><br></br>
 

<h2>MYSORE</h2>

<p>A trip to the land of rich heritage and culture, a place which has stood the test of time and seen many people been built and fall, a trip to Mysore.

In this duration, you’ll not only experience the local cuisines and monuments but also get a hand’s on experience of Indian culture and lifestyle.</p><br></br>


<h2>HAMPI</h2> 

<p>A fantasy world of rocks and ruins, a carnival of carvings. 
A rhapsody in stone, Hampi, the erstwhile capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, has now been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Magnificent religious and architectural ruins of the Hoysala Empire dot an unearthly landscape characterized by giant boulders perched precariously over miles of undulating terrain. Let the adventurer within you be enchanted by the enigmatic Vittala Temple with its Musical Pillars and Stone Chariot. Marvel at the grandeur of the life the Royals must’ve lived as you explore the Royal and Zanana Enclosure. Bask in the mesmerizing view from the top of Hanuman Temple after completing a climb of 600 steps. The Jade-green palm groves, banana plantations and paddy fields offset the rusty hues and create an exquisite kaleidoscopic effect. Experience serenity and feel the wind in your hair while relaxing at the banks of Sanapur Lake or as you explore Hippie Island on a moped. Feel a sense of contentment that you haven’t before. A delight for backpackers and pilgrims alike, Hampi is the ideal getaway, and no one should miss out on this exhilarating experience.</p><br></br>


<h2>COORG</h2>

										<h3>Manipal Week:</h3>

<p>The International Association for Exchange of Students for Technical Experience is back with its flagship set of events. We are ready to host all visiting interns, throughout the nation, during the most happening week in the most happening town in India, this August. Be prepared for 6 days packed with events such as an International Cuisine Night, Scavenger Hunt, International Day, Annual IAESTE ball, Sports Day and Mahakavya. Each of these events have been specifically designed to help you dive into the depths of Indian culture, while sharing with us a glimpse of yours.</p>

<h3>Annual IAESTE Ball:</h3>

<p>Prepare yourself for the Annual IAESTE Ball, an evening of grandeur and panache, organized beautifully enough to even put Prince Charming to shame. A perfect opportunity to ask that special someone out on a date to truly get to know him/her. So put on that fancy white tux or that gorgeous black dress and walk into the ballroom with your stunning date, to taste the finest wine in South India while waltzing to the greatest hits of Marvin Gaye.</p>



<h3>International Cuisine Night:</h3>

<p>Prepare your taste buds for delicious food from all over the globe. The International Cuisine Night, held in the finest kitchen in Manipal, that produced the likes of Vikas Khanna (6 time Michelin star winning chef), is something for every “foodie” to look forward too. From Pretzels to Pancakes and from Dbukbokkie to Dal Makkhani, learn what it truly feels like to live in Manipal by experiencing the spirit of internationalism like never before. Chak de Duniya!</p>

<h3>Scavenger Hunt:</h3>

<p>Grab that deerstalker cap and magnifying glass that’s been laying in your wardrobe gathering dust, because we’re going to take you on an adventure in and around the magnificent university town of Manipal! Explore the beautiful contours of our hot and humid hometown, while collecting tiny fragment like clues, each of which shall teach you something glorious about Indian culture and history.</p>

<h3>International Day:</h3>

<p>Come feel what it truly like is to be in Manipal, by celebrating your country’s culture in a university town that that harbors students of over 40 nationalities as full time residents and welcomes students from over 85 different countries every year as interns. This day is dedicated to those interns that wish to share fragments of perhaps what is closest to their heart- Their Country. It could be as simple as setting up a stall to distribute specific handicrafts inspired by their country, or as breathtaking as dramatizing a certain nationalistic or religious ideology.</p>

<h3>Sports Day:</h3>

<p>If there is one thing that you should know about our country, it is the fact that sport unites us like nothing else. So be ready to put on slip hat nylon jersey, tie up those running shoes and feel the true heat of Manipal as you dash towards the starting line, a.k.a. “The infamous Manipal Institute of Technology grounds” for our most testosterone filled event of the semester. Presenting to you sports as diverse as the people that reside in this country, we cater to the sportsman inside of you by presenting to you sports like Kabaddi, Seven Stones, Gilli Danda, Kho-Kho, Cricket, Football, Basketball and many more.</p>

<h3>Sanskriti:</h3>

<p>Be prepared to knock off the start to a truly exasperating week by witnessing everything that is truly India. The word “Sanskriti” literally means culture in Hindi, and boy are you in for a ride. India is proud to present itself as a country with extremely diverse cultures and beliefs and we, at The International Association for Exchange of Students for Technical Experience, wish to share these cultures and beliefs with all visiting interns by hosting events such as “#put planned Indian themed events here#”.</p>

<h3>Mahakavya (Cultural Night):
</h3>
<p>Take your seat in the T.A.R.D.I.S. and hold on tight as we take you back to the Dvapara Yuga, that lasted 864,000 years and ended in 3102 BCE when Lord Krishna returned to his eternal abode of Vaikuntha.</br>

After visiting The Dvapapra Yuga and witnessing The Mahbharata, perhaps the most epic battle in the history of mankind and Hindu mythology, we shall fast forward to the India, colonized and shackled by the British Throne to portray to you the birth of emotions of freedom in great men and women such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Ranilaxmi Bai.
